  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:2609 - SmartGuide is more efficient (better guiding and runtime)
   when used with explicit timing constraints. If you want the full benefit of
   the SmartGuide flow, please add timing constraints to your design, then
   re-create your guide file.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:980 - The following NGM file is used during SmartGuide:
   "C:\Users\HO_win7\Documents\FPGA\basic_pipline\MIPS_map.ngm". The NGM file
   contains information on how the guide file was originally mapped. It is
   required for the best SmartGuide results.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

  Estimated SmartGuide Results
  ----------------------------
  This section describes the guide results after placement. Re-implemented 
  components are components that were guided, but moved in order to satisfy
  timing requirements.

    Estimated Percentage of guided Components                 | 100.0%
    Estimated Percentage of re-implemented Components         |   0.0%
    Estimated Percentage of new/changed Components            |   0.0%
    Estimated Percentage of fully guided Nets                 | 100.0%
    Estimated Percentage of partially guided or unrouted Nets |   0.0%

  A detailed SmartGuide report (.GRF) can be generated during PAR by
  specifying the [-smartguide <guidefile[.ncd]>] switch on the PAR
  command line. The GRF file contains all components and nets that were
  not guided. A final summary report is always generated and is available
  in the PAR report file and in the GRF regardless of the PAR -smartguide switch.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
